// The game is rock, paper, scissors. It is always played by 2 fighting hands and 2 fighting hands only.
// Each round can only have one winning hand. And to tell the winner, we need to compare both hands.
// 
// Note: Hand and outcome scores _are not_ dependent. For example, by choosing scissors you are _guaranteed_ to earn 3 points.
//
// **Gameplay**:
// The game is played by 2 players â€”myself and the opponent. Each player chooses a hand and the winner is determined by the rules above.
// We'll use a encrypted strategy guide that tells us what hand myself and the opponent will choose for each round.
// The game is played in rounds. Each line of the guide will define the hand for each player for that round.
// The hand for each player will be defined by a word. Each player will have a set of words to define their hand.
//
// Myself hands:
// - Rock: X
// - Paper: Y
// - Scissors: Z
//
// Opponent words:
// - Rock: A
// - Paper: B
// - Scissors: C
// 
// So a round example will be in the form of:
// A Y
// 
// Meaning that the opponent chose rock (A) and myself paper (Y). 
// Round winner: myself.
// Round scores:
//  Opponent: 0 + 1 = 1
//  Myself: 6 + 2 = 8
